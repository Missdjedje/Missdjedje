- 👋 Hi, I’m @Missdjedje
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, linocut and medicinal plants. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to become a (good) front-end developer and ui/ux designer. I still can't choose, I like both disciplines.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on helpful projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: lw.djedje@gmail.com
